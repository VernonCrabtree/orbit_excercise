# Exercise Answers README

## Overview

This repository contains answers to a series of exercises, detailed in the following markdown files:
- [Case-1.md](./Case-1.md)
- [Case-2.md](./Case-2.md)
- [Case-3.md](./Case-3.md)

Each of these files provides a response to specific case studies or problems that were generated with the assistance of ChatGPT. The responses have been reviewed and I concur with the outcomes and methodologies presented.

## Approach and Verification

The answers in the markdown files are based on interactions with ChatGPT, where I adapted the prompts to ensure accurate, relevant, and contextually appropriate responses were generated. Here is the approach taken:

1. **Problem Definition**: Clearly defined the problem in a structured format for ChatGPT to understand.
2. **Interaction**: Engaged with ChatGPT to refine the answers, ensuring clarity and correctness.
3. **Review and Adaptation**: Evaluated the responses and made necessary adjustments to align with expected outcomes.

## Real-World Application Caution

In real-world applications, it is critical to assess the sensitivity of the data and the details of the code before submitting such information to ChatGPT or any AI tool. This step ensures that no sensitive, proprietary, or confidential information is disclosed inadvertently. Always:
- Review data for sensitivity.
- Anonymize identifiable information.
- Validate the context and compliance of the data used in queries.

## Agreement

By utilizing these responses, I acknowledge the process of adaptation and review I have undertaken to reach these conclusions. I confirm my agreement with the answers provided in the referenced markdown files.
